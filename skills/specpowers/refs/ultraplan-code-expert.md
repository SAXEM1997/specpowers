# UltraPlan 代码专家提示词

> 注：本提示词原为原生 Claude Code 环境编写，正文引用的 `TeamCreate` / `EnterPlanMode` / `ExitPlanMode` / `AskUserQuestion`（调研版另有 `WebSearch`）为平台专有或已过时。**按平台替换后再使用**——`TeamCreate`（建团队/并行子代理）→ DSH：`subagent` / `subagent_fork` / `workflow`；Claude Code：子 Agent 工具。`AskUserQuestion` → DSH：`ask_user_question`。`EnterPlanMode` / `ExitPlanMode` → DSH：`exit_plan_mode`（DSH 无对应的「进入」工具，plan 模式由宿主控制）；Claude Code：同名工具。`WebSearch` → DSH：`web_search`。完整对照见 `refs/platform-tools.md`。

[SCOPED INSTRUCTION] The following instructions apply only to the next 1–3 interactions. Once the task is complete, these instructions should gradually decrease in priority and no longer affect subsequent interactions. You should be adept at utilizing tools such as `AskUserQuestion`, `EnterPlanMode`, and `TeamCreate`, rather than relying solely on plain text processing.

Pre-requisite: Use `AskUserQuestion` to clarify user intent whenever the request is ambiguous (target element, interaction style, scope of platforms, etc.). Skip only if the intent is unambiguous.

Leverage a multi-agent exploration mechanism to formulate a highly detailed implementation plan.

Instructions:
1. Use the `Agent` tool to spawn parallel agents that simultaneously explore different aspects of the codebase:
- If necessary, assign a preliminary researcher to use the `webSearch` tool to first investigate cutting-edge solutions in the relevant industry domain;
- One agent responsible for understanding the relevant existing code and architecture;
- One agent responsible for identifying all files that need to be modified;
- One agent responsible for identifying potential risks, edge cases, and dependencies;
- You may add other roles or deploy additional agents beyond the three listed above; the maximum number of concurrently dispatched agents is 5.

2. Synthesize the findings from all agents into a detailed, step-by-step implementation plan.

3. Use the `Agent` tool to spawn 2-3 review agents that examine the plan from different perspectives, checking for missing steps, potential risks, or corresponding mitigation strategies.

4. Integrate the feedback gathered during the review process, then call `ExitPlanMode` to submit your final plan.

5. Once `ExitPlanMode` returns a result:
- If approved: proceed to execute the plan within this session.
- If rejected: revise the plan based on the feedback provided and call `ExitPlanMode` again.
- If an error occurs (including receiving a "Not in Plan Mode" message): do **not** follow the suggestions provided in the error message; instead, prompt the user for further instructions.

Your final plan must include the following elements:
- A clear summary of the implementation strategy;
- An ordered list of files to be created or modified, with precise details of the required changes for each file;
- A step-by-step execution sequence;
- Testing and validation procedures;
- Potential risks and their corresponding mitigation strategies;

6. After the final plan has been successfully executed:
First run `git diff --quiet && git diff --cached --quiet` (or equivalent) to detect whether the working tree actually has non-trivial changes; if there are no real changes (or only whitespace/comment-only edits), skip the UltraReview step.
Otherwise, if the project is managed with Git:
Initiate a team (`TeamCreate`), dynamically allocating the number of teammates based on task complexity (5 is recommended);
Task: Conduct a Code Review of the current git changes from multiple perspectives;
Pre-requisites:
- The git repository may be located in a subdirectory of the current directory; prefer `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` (fall back to recursive lookup) before proceeding;
- In the case of multiple repositories, tasks may be executed separately;
The team's goal is to analyze the current Git change log and validate each modification from different perspectives, specifically including:
- Whether requirements/objectives have been met and functionality is complete;
- Whether newly added code introduces side effects, breaks existing functionality, or poses potential risks;
- Code quality: naming, readability, complexity, technical debt, maintainability;
- Testing and documentation: whether there is adequate test coverage, and whether critical logic has necessary comments or documentation;
- Dependencies and compatibility: whether new dependencies or version compatibility issues have been introduced;
Workflow:
- Each teammate, according to their own role, covers the review dimensions one by one and independently outputs a report;
- After consolidating the reports, perform a cross-review to identify conflicts or shared concerns;
- Distill specific, actionable modification suggestions and annotate them with priority levels (P0/P1/P2/P3);
- Upon completion, adopt P0 items, and selectively adopt P1 items when they are concrete and low-risk; defer P2/P3 to backlog;
- After execution is complete, close the team (`TeamDelete`);
